To accurately validate if a prompt has an example, you can ask the following questions:

Does the prompt contain a specific instance or illustration of a concept, idea, or situation?
Is there a clear demonstration or explanation of how something should be done, described, or approached within the prompt?
Are there any comparisons or analogies used to provide context or a better understanding of the main subject?
Does the prompt mention any particular person, event, or object that serves to illustrate the main subject or topic?
If the answer to any of these questions is 'yes', then it is likely that the prompt contains an example. Keep in mind that some examples might be subtle or indirect, so it is essential to carefully analyze the content and context of the prompt.
